# HR-Data-Analysis
The primary objective of the project is to analyze human resources data in order to identify the causes of attrition and formulate various employee retention strategies. I utilized various tools such as SQL for exploratory data analysis, Excel for data cleaning, Tableau, and Power BI for visualization purposes. With these tools, I developed interactive dashboards that highlight the causes of attrition across various departments, job roles, educational backgrounds, genders, and other factors. These dashboards facilitate effective decision-making by management in implementing employee retention strategies, thereby fostering the growth and efficiency of the organization.
